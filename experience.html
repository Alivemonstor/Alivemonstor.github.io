                I’m currently in my final year of college, my course being games development and coding level 3. During this course i have learnt a magnitude of things that i could never learnt by myself, this includes things like 3D Modelling, Levelling, Texturing, 2D Pixel Art, among a magnitude of other things. Unfortunately, the one thing this course did not specialise in that well is coding, which I have taken the time to learn myself for the past 4-5 years at home. During this time i also learnt multiple other basic coding concepts just based on a blueprint game engine called construct. Construct has helped me learn not how to code but how to understand code better and how things in game engines work without me coding it, which has helped me outside of my college course in my personal work. It also allowed me to make this website with understanding how websites are made and the importance of some of the main mechanics / functions a website should include.

            <p>At the moment, I’m a freelance script developer apart of the FiveM (GTA 5 Multiplayer Mod) modding community, this has entailed me to learn many skills mainly the ability to understand and write code in languages including: Lua, CSS, HTML, JS, SQL and JS frameworks such as React, Svelte, Vue and Bootstrap. Learning all of this stuff outside of education has helped me understand quicker when it comes to my game’s development course at college, because I’ve learnt most of the beginner and novice programming practices outside of college. With learning all of these programming languages, I’ve managed to run my freelancing business for the last 2 years and along this 2-year period I’ve managed to make lots of connections within this community where I’ve managed to make a name for myself within the FiveM developing community, I’ve also learnt to run a team with some opportunities throwing me into a lead development position. Alongside learning to run a team, I’ve also learnt to understand a mature work ethic and have learnt to work in a professional work environment with a proper team. At the moment i'm also apart of the qbcore team, where we moderate the QBCore(FiveM Framework) discord with over 25,000 people, we help support people with their code and also any issues they may be having with the framework.</p>
